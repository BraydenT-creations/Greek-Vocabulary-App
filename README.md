# Greek-Vocabulary-App
A simple app using Python intended to aid in studies of Classical Greek. Simply put, vocabulary is entered, as well as the parts of speech and their declensions or conjugations, respectively. This allows for quick and easy access to words via the search bar (English to Greek or Greek to English), or for study via quizzes and tests.
